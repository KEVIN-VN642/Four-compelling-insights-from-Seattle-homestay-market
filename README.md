## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
All we need are the Anaconda distribution of Python. Python should be version 3.*.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"> </a>

For this project, I used Airbnb data in Seattle in 2016 to answer following questions:
1. When is the right time for a trip
2. What are the top listing hosts in Seattle?
3. What property types suit you?
4. How do hosts' response time and rate relate to customer ratings?

## File Descriptions <a name = "files"></a>

- One jupyter notebook "Seattle Airbnb" to contain all codes related to project. 
- One microsoft word file "Four compelling insights from Seattle homestay market.docx" to document findings.
- Two folders: "Images" contains necessary images for reports and "Data" contains Airbnb data for the project. 

## Results <a name = "results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@nghiavuduc/four-compelling-insights-of-seattle-homestay-market-2cc061d7c1b2) or you can find in the file "Four compelling insights from Seattle homestay market.docx"
